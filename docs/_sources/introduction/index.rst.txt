What is SEMA?
----------------

**The Smart Embedded Management Agent (SEMAÂ®)** |br|

Downtime of devices or systems is not acceptable in today's industries. To help customers to analyze their 
systems and take counter measures for preventive maintenance, |COMPANY| has developed a tool which is able to 
monitor and collect system performance and status information from the hardware in a timely, flexible and 
precise manner.

A Board Management Controller collects all relevant technical information from the chipset and other sources.
Using the System Management Bus driver, an application layer fetches the data and presents it to the user. 
|COMPANY| provides a ready-made application that shows the data in user-friendly graphic interfaces, suitable 
for supervision and troubleshooting.

Features
----------
|SPN| is designed to be:

* CPU Operation Modes
* Memory Information
* Network Information
* ACPI Power Management
* HDD S.M.A.R.T
* BIOS Updates
* Heartbeat
* Power Consumption
* User Area Access
* I2C Bus Control
* Temperatures(CPU and Board)
* Board Information (Serial Number, Part Number, Firmware Version...)
* Fan Control
* GPIO Control
* 1-Wire Bus
* A/D Conversion

Detailed forensic information is available after system or module failures. The BMC Power-Up Error Log function
provides detailed information about history of failures that may have occurred during power-up sequences. 
Log information includes e.g. error number, flags, restart event, power cycles, boot count, status, CPU temperature 
and board temperature. Moreover minimum and maximum temperature of the CPU and system is available, as well 
as HDD S.M.A.R.T information- all of which can be used to analyze system or module failure in detail.
